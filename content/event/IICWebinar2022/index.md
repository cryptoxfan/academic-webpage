location: Virtual

summary: An IIC webinar about impact of distributed ledgers on service provider networks 
abstract: We've all heard of the various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rely on distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), such as blockchain, to provide decentralization and immutability. Industrial companies use DLTs for everything from shipping-container tracking, vehicle identity and history, to energy trading and farm-to-store tracking. But what about the operational impact of these peer-to-peer distributed ledgers on the service provider network, for example, in terms of network load? Are there certain architectures that work better than others? Conversely, are there any opportunities for service providers to leverage DLT’s to provide additional services or improve the network’s overall performance, for example, managing routing state, user membership information, or others? We analyze here how blockchains affect a service provider network.
