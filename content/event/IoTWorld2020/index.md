summary: A talk about securing IoT systems with blockchain
abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain are two technologies that are gaining popularity since their creation. While the IoT is transforming business processes and consumer behaviors, blockchain promises a number of salient features, such as decentralization, immutability, transparency, etc., which have great potential for tackling the security challenges faced by the IoT systems. This presentation will first talk about the IoT security challenges and the key features provided by blockchain, followed by the description of the blockchain reference architecture (https://www.trusted-iot.org/businesses) developed by Trusted IoT Alliance (TIoTA). With the reference architecture in place, the focus will shift to integration of blockchain technologies into the IoT data lifecycle and discuss how to enhance its security with blockchain. The presentation will wrap up by identifying some challenges when merging the IoT and blockchain.
