abstract: The present invention relates to an elliptic curve cipher system and a realizing method. The system comprises a finite field algorithm module, a point addition and multiplication algorithm module, a scalar multiplication module, a DH cryptographic key negotiation algorithm module and a digital signature and verification module, wherein the finite field algorithm module is used for realizing calculation in a large prime number domain by a Montgomery algorithm; the point addition and multiplication algorithm module realizes point addition calculation and point multiplication calculation on elliptic curves; the scalar multiplication algorithm module is used for realizing the scalar multiplication calculation of the elliptic curve cipher system; the DH cryptographic key negotiation algorithm module is used for invoking the scalar multiplication algorithm module to complete cryptographic key negotiation; the digital signature and verification module is used for invoking the scalar multiplication algorithm module to complete digital signature and verification to information. The present invention provides an elliptic curve cipher system suitable for hardware and a realizing method, module reduction calculation with time consumption does not need to be displayed, and the present invention is simultaneously suitable for software and hardware.
