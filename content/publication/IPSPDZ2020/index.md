abstract: A method for secure multiparty computation of an inner product includes performing multiparty additions to generate a first sum share and a second sum share between two shares of alternating elements from corresponding pairs of elements in a first vector and a second vector, performing multiparty multiplications with at least one other node to generate inner product pair shares corresponding to products of the first sum shares and the second sum shares corresponding to pairs of elements in the first and second vectors, and performing another multiparty addition of each inner product pair share with a first negated shares of pair products corresponding to pairs of elements in the first vector and a second negated shares of pair products corresponding to pairs of elements in the second vector to generate a share of an inner product of the first and second vectors.
