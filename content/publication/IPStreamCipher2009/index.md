abstract: The stream cipher generator comprises three linear feedback shift registers and three linear transforming modules, the three linear transforming modules respectively make configuration for the three linear feedback shift registers; three state reading-out table modules, A, B and C, which respectively read out the data of pre-position in the three linear feedback shift registers; a linear conversion module F for inputting the data outputted from the three sate reading-out table modules, and compressing and scrambling it, and then outputting it; a table looking-up transform module D for compressing and outputting the data outputted from the state reading-out table module; an outputting module for compressing and outputting the data outputted from F, D and C. The stream cipher generator can be allocated at both transmission ends to make synchronized symmetry encryption.
