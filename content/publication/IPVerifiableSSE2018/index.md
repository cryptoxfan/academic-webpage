abstract: A method for verification of search results in an encrypted search process includes transmitting a search query including the encrypted keyword from a client to a server, and receiving a response to the search query and a first plurality of hash values from at least one hash tree from the server. The method further includes generating, a first message authentication code (MAC) based on the response, generating a first regenerated root node hash value using the first MAC, the first plurality of hash values, and a predetermined hash function, and generating an output message with the client indicating that the response is invalid in response to the first regenerated root node hash value not matching a predetermined first root node hash value stored in the memory of the client.
