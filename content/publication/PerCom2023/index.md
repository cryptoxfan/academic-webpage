abstract: Ucam is a user-centric, blockchain-based and end-to-end secure home IP camera system designed by IoTeX. In a Ucam system, all the video clips captured by the camera are encrypted using a user-controlled symmetric key before storing them in the cloud. In this demo paper, we describe the system architecture and implementation of a privacy-preserving object detection proof-of-concept (PoC) for the Ucam system using Veracruz, a confidential computing framework developed by Arm Research. The resulting PoC demonstrates the viability of bringing the object detection capability to the Ucam system without leaking users sensitive information.
