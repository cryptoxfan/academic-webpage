abstract: In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving mutual authentication protocol for RFID systems using the recently proposed ultra-lightweight cryptographic algorithm Hummingbird-2. The new protocol is resistant to the most common attacks against the security and privacy of RFID systems. Furthermore, we also address efficient implementation of the proposed protocol on a batteryless, MSP430-based WISP tag, and investigate the performance of the key search process on a laptop. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Hummingbird-2 mutual authentication protocol provides a highly effective and efficient security and privacy solution for low-cost passive RFID tags.
