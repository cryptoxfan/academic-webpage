abstract: Home IP cameras are consistently among the most popular smart home devices and recent news stories about home IP cameras getting hacked frequently have posed serious security and privacy concerns for consumers. In this paper, we propose Ucam, a user-centric, blockchain-based and end-to-end secure home IP camera system. Ucam leverages advanced technologies such as blockchain, end-to-end encryption and trusted computing to address a number of vulnerabilities in the existing solutions. In the Ucam design, we replace traditional username/password based login approach with a one-click, blockchain-based passwordless counterpart and apply the resurrecting duckling security model to secure device binding. In particular, we utilize blockchain extensively to manage device ownership and provide integrity protection for the video clips stored locally or remotely. For coping with privacy, the end-to-end encryption, which is coupled with a user-centric, secure element enhanced key management scheme, is implemented in Ucam. Finally, Ucam employs re-encryption with Intel SGX as well as key refreshing to enable the sharing of encrypted video clips and live streaming videos, respectively. The security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that Ucam is able to meet the increasing security and privacy requirements for home IP camera systems with negligible performance overhead.
