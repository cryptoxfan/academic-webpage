abstract: ZigBee Smart Energy is the world's leading standard for interoperable products that monitor, control, inform and automate the delivery and use of energy and water. The ZigBee Smart Energy Profile (SEP) specification uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for implementing certificate-based key establishment (CBKE) between communicating devices. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of OpenECC, the first open-source library supporting ECC-based protocols for ZigBee SEP version 1.x. The experimental results demonstrate the high performance and small memory footprint of the OpenECC library when deployed on the current generation of Zigbee Smart Energy platform. Our work is the first step towards securing ZigBee Smart Energy applications using open-source libraries.
