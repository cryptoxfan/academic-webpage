abstract: Hummingbird is a recently proposed lightweight cryptographic algorithm for securing RFID systems. In 2011, Saarinen reported a chosen-IV, chosen-message attack on Hum- mingbird in FSE'll. In this paper, we propose a lightweight remedial scheme in response to the Saarinen's attack. The scheme is quite efficient both in software and hardware since only two cyclic shifts are involved. Using this simple tweak, we can keep the compact design of Hummingbird as well as enhance the security of Hummingbird. Readers are welcome to attack the remedial Hummingbird.
